    <h2>Naming</h2>
    <p>Pet Rock got his name immediately i saw him because at first he was hiding inside his shell and looked like a <em>rock</em>.</p>
    <h2>Playing</h2>
    <p>After a while we became best friends and played together all the time.</p>
    <p> Our favorite game was 'roll over and back'</p>
